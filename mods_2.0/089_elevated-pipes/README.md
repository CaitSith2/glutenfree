Huge thanks to Quezler for doing all the coding, I only did the visuals.

This mod adds elevated pipes, they are able to go over machines and lava. Also allow for pipe weaving to some extent.

The footprint is 1x1 so you can use it in spaces too tight for normal underground pipes.
The connections between pillars are created automatically.

The inspiration for this mod came because of my obsession with making compact builds, 
while playing Pyanodon's I used to vent off a lot of gasses when I had no use for them, but once I found a use for them I wanted to convert my machines to collect it instead, and I couldn't do it with regular undergrounds because of their footprint, so that's how this mod came to be.
