Air purifiers are neat and all, but bringing clean filters to them and getting the used filters back to a cleaning station is annoying.

This mod makes it so that all air purifiers are serviced by construction robots, you'll be able to see any missing filters as alert, and you're also able to use this mod before you unlock logistic bots & requester chests, which is pretty neat if i say so myself.

I would reccomend that you also use my [Pollution Tool](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/pollution-tool) mod, so you know how many you need for a given setup/selection.
