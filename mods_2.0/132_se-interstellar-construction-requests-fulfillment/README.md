If you cannot be bothered so send construction materials to planets via rockets or ships, this might be the mod for you.

This mod was developed/tested in a controlled environment on a pre-multi-planet SE save, performance issues and bugs can be expected.

1.0 info:

The balance, if any, is that it takes a large amount of power for every single item you send,
so stuff you use en-masse like conveyors and inserters might still be worth sending via rocket.

(currently) not supported:
- deliveries other than modules
- no players online
- a "travel delay"

1.1 info:

You now only need one turret per logistic network, at the moment there are no power costs.

Adding a capsule is not feasible since the point ammo texture has no mask, and copying & recolloring it would break the space exploration licence.

Basically this mod is currently unbalanced as fuck, you just need a cannon at your mall and construction bots at the destination surface to place stuff.

todo:
- handle shooting to networks with no storage space available
- figuring out a nice cost that isn't a burden to distribute
- possibly looking into a shooting delay, but then again several turrets in the same network impacts performance and requests aren't split across them
- since you currently only need one i could have used the weapon delivery cannon texture as a base so its a large building, but i like the 4 barrels
