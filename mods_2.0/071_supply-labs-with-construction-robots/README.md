every 60 seconds (or when the active research changes) all labs that support the required packs for that research will be periodically supplied.

this mod currently does not check for availability of passive provider chests / construction drones / roboports, i suggest adding the mod after robotics tech.

tested in k2 + se, but this mod should theoretically support labs from any mods and science packs with stack sizes other than 200, feel free to report bugs.
