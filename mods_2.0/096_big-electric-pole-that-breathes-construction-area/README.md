When you research something that unlocks the `roboport` recipe, all existing and newly placed big electric poles will gain a construction area.

Their range matches the horizontal/vertical wire distance, with an extra margin of 2 to help clear any obstacles for the next pole.

Currently only the force `player` is supported, though it will not be hard to add support for other forces.
