Being able to place these on occupied tiles is worthy of the chef's kiss, but not being able to snap these somewhat seriously annoys my OCD.

Therefore this mod snaps it to either the center (can touch 1 machine), edge (can touch 2 machines), or a corner (can touch 4 machines).

Worry not, the dots on the thumbnail were simply placed with paint and are thus not aligned, but the positions ingame will be.

- affects existing addon power poles 
- ghosts will get snapped once built
