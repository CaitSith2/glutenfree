### 1.0.0

Similar experience to the nanobots mod many of you all know,
cheap and easy to craft and usable right from the start of map.

This mod adds cheap construction robots that will spoil in one minute,
though if the stack spoils in a player's inventory it'll only spoil one item.

This is to make sure the handcraft-only bots cannot be used practically once you get roboports online,
and due to their spoiling nature you'll want to transition to modular armor and real construction bots eventually.

Note that until you transition to modular armor you'll want to not wear any armor at all or this mod fails to work.
(also, try to avoid having any construction robots in your inventory before you switch to personal roboport equipment)

### 1.1.0

Increased the transport belt cost from 1 to 10, and changed the crafting time from 0.5 to 2.5 seconds,
in exchange you'll no longer lose 1 bot per minute as long as you do not wear any piece of armor at all.

### 2.0.0

For 2 iron gears and 10 yellow belts you get 50 construction bots that can do one task each,
a task is measured when the robot held an item and is now no longer holding it.

The bots do not spoil anymore so the mod is usable without any expansion flags enabled,
they can be used in roboports after handcrafting but that seems ill advised.
