Version: 0.0.6
Date: ????
  Info:
    - Begin storing pipes to ground in surfacedata
    - Make new struct constructor prettier
    - Attempt to centralize creating and updating the directional heat pipes
    - Pull surface and force out of the struct
    - Strip even/odd from the localized name since it just got me confused with single/duo
    - Dis & re connect the single/duo when rotating
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.5
Date: 2024. 11. 22
  Info:
    - Revert 06e0299, connecting shall replace both end caps
    - Get rid of the single/duo
    - Figure out how to connect the textures without going through hell
    - Apparently heat pipes are 1-1, even though they will still try to connect
    - Revert the last 4 commits
    - Detect when something with heat pipes gets placed over an underpass
    - Initial test or refreshing the entities after something gets placed in between
    - Create a new underpass struct when bringing them to front
    - Setup surfacedata
    - Flush brain buffer
    - Try to write a custom iterator
    - Begin transition from struct to surfacedata (since entities switch unit numbers a lot)
    - Attempt to fix the rotation handler
    - Hmm this causes an infinite loop too
    - Fix the infinite loop
    - Prevent identical overpasses from stacking

Version: 0.0.4
Date: 2024. 11. 22
  Info:
    - Begin giving disconnected undergrounds a heat pipe
    - Draw the disconnected sprite in its default state
    - Remove the directional heat pipe upon pipe to ground removal
    - Well rip, normal heat pipes are still visually connecting
    - Prevent connections in unauthorized directions
    - Allow the underground heat pipe to be rotated
    - Same pipe prototypes always visually connect, checkerboard alternate them
    - Preserve heat when rotating
    - Fast rotate does not preserve temperature
    - Delete the old heat pipe after the new one to prevent blinking
    - Change the horizontal and vertical to sit between the undergrounds
    - Prepare the mode that can connect to what's behind
    - Switch structs from single to dual mode when connected
    - Only set the ending sprite for the current direction
    - Get the visuals to behave how i want
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.3
Date: 2024. 11. 21
  Info:
    - Calculate which heatpipe length is required to link the two
    - Data tweaks
    - Place the long heat pipe between the undergrounds
    - Shift the heat pipe endings to the far ends
    - Prevent the center from showing a sprite
    - Make the connectors show capped off initially
    - Make sure the capped ones do not creep through the textuere
    - Oh just great, some side by side heat pipes are connecting even when there are no connections
    - Ponder whether i should continue using 1 heat pipe (endpoint freezing)
    - Remove the connection sprite messing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.2
Date: 2024. 11. 21
  Info:
    - Reuse the underground belt sprite for the smaller end points
    - Extent and minable fix
    - Setup the initial directional reactors
    - Fix reactor length and mask
    - Localize the internal entity
    - Add some virtual signals to the internal icons (not that anyone will see them)
    - Set the heat connection points and change type
