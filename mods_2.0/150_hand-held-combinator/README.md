Not to be confused with a handheld combinator, oh and ghosts output a signal of -1.

Note: currently does not come with a player selection gui, to place one for another player:
1) place one down
2) edit the character signal and guess their player index (sequential up from one)
3) copy paste the combinator elsewhere
4) notice the player name above it

Also note:
- you cannot edit the player after the combinator has been built
- the first filters of the first two sections will get overwritten
