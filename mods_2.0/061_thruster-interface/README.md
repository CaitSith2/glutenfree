Tool for stress testing platforms.

After placement click on the gui to configure it, thrust is based on that of the spage age thruster, quality is supported.

Grab yourself a thruster interface, some supported methods are:
`/c game.player.force.recipes["thruster-interface"].enabled = true` (to select the thruster interface in any mode)
`/c game.player.cursor_ghost = "thruster-interface"` (in case you are viewing the platform with remote view)
`/c game.player.insert("thruster-interface")` (in case you're on the platform as character/editor)

Additionally if Editor Extensions is installed you can find at the bottom of their item list.

(versions below 2.0.35 are supported manually by editing the info.json, do not upgrade the quality on lower verions)
