A furnace that only crafts whilst fluids are forced to flow through it with a pump,
inspired by Krastorio 2's pollution filter rebalance, this makes cleaning them take no biomass.

Graphics based on a very old mod of mine, the 12th in fact: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Liquify

Requires fluids to flow through at more than 1000/s, this fluid harmlessly just passes through.

Designed to be placed inline of high flow rate pipes, cannot be chained without a pump in between.
