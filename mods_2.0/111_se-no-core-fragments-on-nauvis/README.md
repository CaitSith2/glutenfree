This mod hides all the core seams on nauvis, other/pvp homeworlds are currently not supported.

The goal of this mod is to encourage you to do more on other planets since nauvis will eventually be mined dry.
(effectively getting rid of furnaces and such on nauvis, making it a production powerhouse of shipped in goods)

Use `/se-no-core-fragments-on-nauvis disable` before removing the mod to keep smoke and map tags intact.
