Time really flies by, it is time for my 200th mod!
For this special occasion lets dig up a pet project that never really went forgotten: "Concrete Roboports"

Back in March 2023 i lay the groundwork for said mod, the idea was to make it easier to make sub networks within a larger network,
Since roboports connect if their orange zones touch i wanted to keep them small, so what about a network you can shape with tiles?

Over the years it gained some love but there were always some caveats that kept me from wrapping up the mod:
- rendering, 1x1 roboports only draw the dotted lines at certain angles since they aren't drawn in between, but rather from one
- performance, having tons of 1x1 roboports can't be healthy, i learned the term "tiling algorithm" recently but at the time i was lost
- connectivity, some mods add roboports with a connecting range larger than orange which would prevent them from hiding isolated in the green

I have touched up the mod a little since my modding skills did evolve in the two years since, mainly in part to this awesome community!
In the past i struggled understanding concepts such as global/storage but there were always people willing to take the time to explain,
nowadays i can often be found roaming the modding channels and trying to help out where i can, passing on knowledge to new brave souls.

So yeah, thanks Factorio modding community for making me feel at home, i am here to stay and looking forward to see what the future brings!
