-- Currently roboports connect when their `logistics_connection_distance` squares touch.

-- Unfortunately this means that when you want a roboport that doesn't connect to lets say anything more than a few tiles away you can't just set _that_ roboport to `logistics_connection_distance` lets say `5` and have a roboport with a `logistics_connection_distance` of `15` a mere 10 tiles away since they connect by squares and not by having the smallest of the two touch the other roboport with pseudocode amonst the lines of: `math.min(a.logistics_connection_distance, b.logistics_connection_distance)`


-- Other properties i've considered but didn't stuck to include:
-- - `max_connection_mode = "logistics_connection_distance" / max_connection_mode = "logistics_radius"`
-- - `connection_mode = "logistics_connection_distance" / connection_mode = "logistics_radius"`
