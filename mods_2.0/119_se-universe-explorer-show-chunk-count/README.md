Marked as a cheat since knowing the generated chunk count (vs visible-to-your-force chunks) could provide an edge in rare pvp scenarios.

This mod is highly dependent on the universe explorer list layout at the time of release, it'll break or act weird if they move stuff around.

Note: it updates when you open the gui, so when you delete a surface it'll still have the old number and new surfaces will show 0 at the start.
