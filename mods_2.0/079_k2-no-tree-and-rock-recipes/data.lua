data.raw["technology"]["kr-decorations"] = nil

-- allright so apparently krastorio has this check (GNU LGPLv3) in their code,
-- so all i apparently needed to do was disable the tech, i went into making this mod
-- fully prepared i had to find and yeet all the rocks and trees but someone saw this coming.

-- local tech = data.raw["technology"]["kr-decorations"]
-- if not tech then
--   return
-- end
