In the core miner drill gui you'll see a new configurable slider at the bottom,
you can set it anywhere from 0 to the maximum amount of core seams on that planet/moon.

The output, power usage & pollution will scale accordingly,
you can "underclock" drills in order to have multiple setups.

Slider value is not preserved through blueprints, just so you know.
