A ~~planet~~ world of goo, unlocked at the same time as oil processing and interacted with through remote view,
inspired by that wonderful puzzle game (which i highly recommend you check out, as well as the two human games)

what to expect:
- baren worldgen similar to fulgora
- vaults are replaced with various goo spawning pipes
- use trains to move all the fluids around to where they are needed
- not really any unlocks but perhaps you can put the goo balls to use elsewhere~
