Adds a bottomless variant of the 1x1 logistic storage chest.

Perfect for when you have millions of items laying around and the bots take forever to reach the furthest chest.

Upon placement it will try to guess what item you want to put in it in this order:
1) item already in it, like when you place the bottomless over another chest
2) the item in the filter, like when you have it blueprinted already
3) the item you have the most of in the logistic storage network

When an item is determined it'll issue deconstruction orders for any other chests that have that item so it defragments.

You cannot use inserters or loaders on the bottomless storage chest, only logistic robots will be able to interact.

When `Space Exploration` is installed then these chests cannot be placed on `Spaceship Floor` for obvious reasons.
