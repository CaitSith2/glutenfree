Sure, having to deal with nauvis core fragments on each planet is a nice challenge,
but personally i'd rather not have to copy paste similair setups to deal with them on each planet.

Moreover having each basic resource readily available makes it annoyingly tempting to craft those there,
whilst i'd rather just have to import any resources that are not that planet's core fragment.

This cheat mod caters to players who focus on only/mainly using core mining drills on each planet,
those that merely seek out plots will probably neither understand nor benefit the need for this mod.

(why even seek out iron/copper core fragment planets if you're already swimming in leftovers? ^-^)
