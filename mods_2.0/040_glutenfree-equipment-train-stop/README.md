[Equipment Gantry](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/equipment-gantry) is neat and all, but it is not fun to have to find and pickup every single one of your potentially hundreds of trains (consisting of several rolling stocks each) and update them one by one, it gets tiring real quick.

This mod attempts to alleviate that pain by introducing a train stop that updates the equipment of each train carriage that rolls under it.

Instructions:
- have a mod installed that adds equipment grid(s) to any or all rolling stock
- place the equipment train stop somewhere that all the trains you want to update pass under (and trains you don't want to upgrade do not)
- put a picked up carriage containing equipment and put it in the template chest
- have one or more trains pass under it at your leisure, any errors will show up as floating text

ps: do not be afraid of the landmine, it is simply to detect when a train passes under it, while i _could_ make it invisible, i haven't yet done so. ^-^
