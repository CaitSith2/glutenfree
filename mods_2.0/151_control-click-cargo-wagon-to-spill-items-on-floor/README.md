Dropped stacks of items are automatically marked for deconstruction.

This is mod is an alternative for opening a train in remote view and clicking each of the 40 slots to order bot extraction.

Thumbnail is a reference to that when the train does finally arrive at the clogged station that it won't wait till it is empty,
but instead notices it is empty and proceeds back to the depot or whatever is the next station the train is expected to head to.

Originally named `control-click-on-cargo-wagon-to-extract-with-bots` but that would leave leftover item request proxies.
