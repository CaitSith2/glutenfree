Due to how this mod works (not being able to 1-1 clone the code of the lifesupport gui due to the licence) you'll need to have this setting set as such:
`mod settings -> per player -> space exploration -> show lifesupport hud = always`

todo: maybe one day have it revert back to lifesupport mode when you land, but for now the mod just permanently overrides it until you remove this mod again.
