For my current playthrough i cannot be bothered to use conveyors and trains **just** to bring core fragments to my central processing plant,
conveyor snakes or trains where core fragments hardly stack in is just repetitive and annoying and make the surfaces too similar for my taste.

This mod links the output inventories of all the core miners on a surface together so you can extract some/all the fragments from any of them.

(the output arrow is gone, you will need to use inserters or loaders)
