> **This mod is being phased out, consider the [Quality condenser](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/quality-condenser) mod instead.**

This mod hides quality modules, in its place you'll unlock the upcycler alongside uncommon and rare quality.

For every x amount of items (configurable in the mod settings) you'll get 1 of the next tier (if you have it unlocked).

Notable configuration options:
- 100, one for every hundred items (1% quality, aka 1 quality 1 modules)
- 50, one for every 50 items (2% quality, aka 2 quality 1 modules)
- 10, one for every 10 items (10% quality, aka 2 quality 3 modules)
- 10, one for every 10 items (10% quality, aka 2 quality 3 modules)
- 4, one for every 4 items (25% quality, aka 4~ legendary quality 3 modules)

Picking up an upcycler that hasn't yet producted output will drop all its pending items on the ground,
multiple items can be upcycled at the same time but the progress bar will only ever show the latest item.

Items with spoil timers are always returned fresh, since this mod counts with circuits and those do not read spoilage.

Note that you can only insert items into the corner of the upcycler with the chomper, and items only output by themselves.

This mod was built with compatibility for the other mods that modify quality stuff in mind,
though if there's an annoying conflict with your mod do reach out and we can try to resolve it.

(this mod is a dumbed down version of https://mods.factorio.com/mod/awesome-sink,
unlike that mod these machines support no quality modules, and do not share a per-surface output inventory)
