Landing pad names are not preserved in the blueprint, a bug that might as well be a feature.

Also note that removing this mod breaks any circuit wires and is likely to leave inserter gaps.

The cargo pods will also appear to land off-center but i cannot modify that from this mod's side.

Already placed cargo landing pads will look smaller and can be "adopted" by building ontop of them.

This mod comes with no waranty, there might come an SE version in which the workaround gets prevented.
