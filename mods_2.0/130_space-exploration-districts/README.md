In 2.0 Factory Planner introduced districts, Space Exploration still uses tile collision checks for building.

This mod replaces the "Cannot be placed on:" descriptions with the "Buildable on:" system from the expansion.

Space Exploration will still use the tile collisions, this mod is only adds the visuals for district support.

(since this is quite an invasive change i will be prototyping it standalone first before offering it as a pr)
