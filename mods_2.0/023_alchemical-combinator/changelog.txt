    - Begin conversion into struct
    - Always lookup struct via id (unit_number is ambiguous when things consist of multiple entities)

    - Add recipe and add to technology
    - Handle combinator being rotated or flipped
    - Do not switch to active when something is being held

    - Support mining the combinator whilst active is active
    - Fix gui not opening anymore

    - Use wichcraft to make it display output signals on hover
    - Fix the duplicate signals by dividing (external signals might interere)
    - Cleanup ã€ƒ
    - Only do on_tick when there are structs to tick
    - Make it technically not require any power so the output signals are always accurate
    - Immediately tick hovered struct so the output shows
