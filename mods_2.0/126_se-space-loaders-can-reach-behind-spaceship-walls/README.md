Each method of spaceship loading has its downsides:
- inserters? slow & landing on an item voids it
- undergrounds? departing voids leftover items
- robots? collisions and liftoff stowaways
- trains? unsymetric and rather spacious

With this mod installed any space loaders facing spaceship walls will be able to interact with the container/wagon directly behind it.
