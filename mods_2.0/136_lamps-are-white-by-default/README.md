In 2.0.33 a bug got fixed that resulted in newly placed lamps being a weird yellow instead of white.

I did notice https://mods.factorio.com/mod/lamp-override prior to starting development on this mod,
but it suggests that it does it with control scripting and always on by default is not always desired.
