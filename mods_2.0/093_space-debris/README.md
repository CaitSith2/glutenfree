When you throw items overboard they'll linger around that point in space and will impact future platforms passing by.

Clumps of items will form that you cannot shoot (they're your items and not enemies after all~) so you'd better mind the environment.

The items will remain a danger until you clean them up by them crashing into your platforms, walls and repair packs are highly recommended.

For simplification reasons (like how on earth do i properly keep track of where on a space connection something gets dropped) the closest location gets picked,
so items dropped in orbit of a planet/location will show up there, less than halfway to other planets, and when you're getting over halfway on your yourney to.
