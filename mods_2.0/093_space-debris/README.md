When you throw items overboard they'll linger around that point in space and will impact future platforms passing by.

Clumps of items will form that you cannot shoot (they're your items and not enemies after all~) so you'd better mind the environment.

The items will remain a danger until you clean them up by them crashing into your platforms, walls and repair packs are highly recommended.
