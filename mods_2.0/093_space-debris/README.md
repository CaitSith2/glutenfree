Items that you have thrown overboard become space debris and have a chance to impact any platform near that location until you clean it up.

The only way to clean them up is to collide with them, turrets will not shoot at debris, and asteroid collectors cannot reclaim those items.

So do try to limit the quantity of items you throw back into space, catch only what you need or have onboard recycling for all of your trash.
