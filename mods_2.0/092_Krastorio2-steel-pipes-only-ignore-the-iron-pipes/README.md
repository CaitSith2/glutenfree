The theme of steel pipes is that they have a higher pressure and therefore need pumps before changing pipes,
whilst honestly 95% of players would likely just prefer them to not connect to normal pipes to run them alongside.

Underground pipes will be allowed to connect to pipes of the other type since they are directional, which makes it intentional.

Due to unavoidable code similarities the `data-final-fixes.lua` file is to be considered `GNU LGPLv3`, the rest is `MIT`. (not that its much)

Note: ingame in the mod manager this mod is called "Steel pipes okay" in order to fit "Base mod > Krastorio 2 > Steel pipes okay" in one line.

Other mods can opt their entities into being ignored from forced compatibility by adding their name to the global `names_ignored_by_steel_pipes` map.
