The theme of steel pipes is that they have a higher pressure and therefore need pumps before changing pipes,

Underground pipes will be allowed to connect to pipes of the other type since they are directional, which makes it intentional.

Due to unavoidable code similarities the `data-final-fixes.lua` file is to be considered `GNU LGPLv3`, the rest is `MIT`.
