The idea comes from the discord user .sOkam! (heysokam) @ https://discord.com/channels/139677590393716737/1217401074877599745/1313339106180202557

Whilst i would have loved to guide him through the process and everything of making a mod that hooks into mine,
its currently a little more convenient if i develop this initial version myself so compatibility is a little more guaranteed.

This mod unlocks the burner upcycler alongside the first assembling machine, and is by default twice as bad.

Note that this mod does not unlock any qualities! Bring your own "all qualities unlocked from the start" mod. (there are many options)
