The space age spinoff for [Space Exploration - interstellar construction requests fulfillment](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/se-interstellar-construction-requests-fulfillment), which was [requested](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/se-interstellar-construction-requests-fulfillment/discussion) to be ported.

Since that mod relied on the prototype data of space exploration i cannot port that as-is without violating the licence,
so this port will be using the cargo pods which have recently gotten api support in 2.0.34, let the building trading begin!
