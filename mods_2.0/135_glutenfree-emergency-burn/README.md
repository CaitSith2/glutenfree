I have only had to use the actual emergency burn once, when krastorio 2 made me believe the labs could only be placed on land and i obviously could not research a gradual descent from nauvis orbit prior to researching.

Whilst i do believe the capsule repair mechanic is rather neat, losing 50% of my inventory however is not.

My inventory tends to hold stuff i often use, and materials to make a handful of something i just so happen to need.

When i setup a faraway outpost for another player (landing pad / cargo rocket / requesting signals) i'd like to get home afterwards to continue my own projects, and i would prefer not to have to pick behind losing 50%, launching an empty cargo rocket with 500k+ fuel req, or leaving items behind.

This mod will change the 50% loss chance to 0%, whether you install this "cheat" mod is entirely up to you.

(ps, emergency burn is not guaranteed to land on nauvis, so i would suggest taking 1-2 spare capules with you)
