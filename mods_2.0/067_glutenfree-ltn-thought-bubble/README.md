As long as a train is underway to its pickup station, all its locomotives will preview what the train is going to pickup "alt mode style", once it arrives at the pickup station it'll vanish again until the next time it gets dispatched from the depot.

The "fake" alt mode sits in the uncanny valley, help with finetuning the looks is appreciated.

Currently only draws one item instead of 4 (or more) like you'd might expect, again: help is welcome.
