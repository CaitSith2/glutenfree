For when you are playing multiplayer with friends and that one guy just cannot stop making stupid choices without consulting you first, like crafting all intentionally stockpiled epic ingredients before legendary quality is unlocked, recycling lower quality stuff in recyclers with speed modules instead of quality, etc.

Ideally this mod sets permissions on you like Space Exploration's remote view did, but in this initial version it'll just prevent you from viewing the surface entirely.

Players that were on a surface or are landing on one will just die and respawn on nauvis without any of their stuff, they should have stayed away.
