If you can't be bothered to add two inserters to each rocket silo (`rocket parts < 100` & `capsule < 1`) this mod is for you, let the construction bots do the work.

As an added bonus any missing construction materials show up in the alerts, so no need to setup speakers to trigger alerts when out of rocket components. ^-^
