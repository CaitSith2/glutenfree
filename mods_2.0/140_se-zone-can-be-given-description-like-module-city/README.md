Wish you could (re)name zones to make universe explorer easier to navigate? well you've come to the right place.

This allows you to give zones a name in the list in addition to its actual name, hopefully it helps.

Due to effort <-> complexity this only affects the universe explorer list and not the star map.

On that same note: searching on the custom names will not work, again due to the effort.

There's only so much i can pull off outside of SE's codebase, a proof of concept.

It's maintainers are free to implement this concept natively in their code.
