Version: 0.0.4
Date: 2024. 11. 28
  Info:
    - Setup a linked chest within the chemical plant
    - Place the linked chest outside so the arrow is flush
    - Nah just keep it inside
    - Make the arrow not collide with the alt mode sprite
    - Update info.json
    - Update readme
    - Setup the hidden surface
    - Put the multiplier code in a shared file
    - Setup the combinator that maps how much each quality is worth
    - Setup initial hidden entity positions
    - Move everything around so there is enough sensible room
    - Setup the other two required arithmetic combinators
    - Make the second inserter only active if there are enough points
    - Swap coin with our own coupon
    - Disable player placed inserters from interacting with hidden inventory entities
    - Add "linked" to the holmium chemical plant chest name
    - Move localizing with quality to final fixes (normal was still hidden)

Version: 0.0.3
Date: 2024. 11. 27
  Info:
    - Pretend holmium solution takes any quality
    - Try to pre-filter the fluidboxes
    - Try to use a dummy holmium solution item
    - Just use 100 of the item directly
    - Abandon output fluidbox
    - Ponder about hiding the inactive covers
    - What if i define both outputs?
    - Crafting machine fluidboxes must be input or output types.
    - Aaaand this overrides everything too
    - Hmm what if i split up into two entities somehow
    - Hmm this also does not work nicely
    - Just add an invisible item that looks like a quality thing
    - Use the item product as the multiplier signaller
    - Make the item spawnable so it lists no rocket capacity
    - Throw the fluid and the recipe productivity together as an icon
    - Drop the fluid name from the quality modifier thing
    - Generate the quality bonus list
    - Test to see if i can add fluid to the output fluidbox

Date: 2024. 11. 27
  Info:

    - Give the tiered chemical plants an icon
    - Shuffle around how holmium solution is shown
    - Step away from using unknown quality
    - Hide the quality icon for the normal tier
    - Fix normal quality giving 0 fluid
    - Fix math order
    - Begin work on control scripting
    - Try to swap entity with the right quality
