  Info:
    - Pretend holmium solution takes any quality
    - Try to pre-filter the fluidboxes
    - Try to use a dummy holmium solution item
    - Just use 100 of the item directly
    - Abandon output fluidbox
    - Ponder about hiding the inactive covers
    - What if i define both outputs?
    - Crafting machine fluidboxes must be input or output types.
    - Aaaand this overrides everything too
    - Hmm what if i split up into two entities somehow
    - Hmm this also does not work nicely
    - Just add an invisible item that looks like a quality thing
    - Use the item product as the multiplier signaller
    - Make the item spawnable so it lists no rocket capacity
    - Throw the fluid and the recipe productivity together as an icon
