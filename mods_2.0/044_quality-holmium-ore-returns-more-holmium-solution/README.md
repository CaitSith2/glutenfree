This mod adds a new chemical plant to which the holmium solution recipe has moved.

Using some trickery to make it both user friendly and stable this mod gives you bonus holmium solution based on the ore's quality.

Normal gives you nothing extra, uncommon × 2, rare × 4, epic × 8, and legendary × 32 `(1 * 2 ^ level)`  

Quality modules can be used inside this machine just fine, it'll count towards the output as usual.

What's that yellow arrow and the white selection box? Well my friend that is the price you have to pay for this mod feeling so smooth.
