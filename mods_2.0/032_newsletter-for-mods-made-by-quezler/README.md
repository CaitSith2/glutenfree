The mod portal has a discoverability problem when an author has a crapton of mods,
good luck discovering any of my new (quality of life) mods when you need to sift through 9+ pages.

This mod will function as a newsletter to inform users of any of my mods when i drop new content,
~~currently this is merely a proof of concept and as of 0.0.1 does nothing apart from just existing.~~

When you have this mod installed you'll have a shortcut button that shows you a list of all my mods, newest releases first.
Updating this mod is not required, but keep in mind that it'll not show new mod releases published after the latest update.

The versioning is structured like this:
`1<year>.1<month><day>.1<hour><minute>`
