Has the same base speed, module slots & power usage as the assembling machine 3,
however the base speed & power usage increase through constant crafting,
once it idles due to insufficient inputs or full output it resets,
however it lacks fluid connections and circuit connectors.

Lightweight, lua only gets called when still ramping up or when stopping.
