Has similar base speed, module slots & power usage as the assembling machine 3,
however the base speed & power usage increase through constant crafting,
once it idles due to insufficient inputs or full output it resets,
however it lacks fluid connections and circuit connectors.

The base speed is 1, and after 400 crafts you hit the 400% cap, which puts you at 5,
note that you can use any modules in the machine, and any beacons can increase it further.
(note that the speed boost of the machine itself does not negate any quality modules at all)

Lightweight, lua only gets called when still ramping up or when stopping.
