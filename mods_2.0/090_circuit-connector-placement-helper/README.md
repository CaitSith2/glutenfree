Adjust offset, reboot, adjust offset, reboot, adjust offset, reboot twice to be sure, does this sound familair to you?
If so you might be entitled to financial compensation (not from me tho), but this mod might ease your future suffering.

With this mod you can place a circuit connector ontop of an existing building and nudge it around to find the sweet spot,
once you are satisfied you can grab an export with the variant and offsets which you can copy paste into your data stage.

The idea was on the backburner for a while, but this message on the Krastorio 2 discord pushed me to get started on it:

Note: this mod is aimed at mod development, this should not be used by normal players and/or in regular playthroughs.

Also, you'll need to set the shadow offset yourself to something pretty, this mod only offers variation and offset.

Usage:
- grab the blueprint book with `/circuit-connector-placement-helper`
- rotate to cycle between the 40 connectors (both through the book and once placed)
- use the arrow keys to nudge it into place (hold shift to nudge further)

Edit: oh sad some reasonable connectors already got placedhttps://codeberg.org/raiguard/Krastorio2/pulls/529 :o
