Adjust offset, reboot, adjust offset, reboot, adjust offset, reboot twice to be sure, does this sound familair to you?
If so you might be entitled to financial compensation (not from me tho), but this mod might ease your future suffering.

With this mod you can place a circuit connector ontop of an existing building and nudge it around to find the sweet spot,
once you are satisfied you can grab an export with the variant and offsets which you can copy paste into your data stage.

The idea was on the backburner for a while, but this message on the Krastorio 2 discord pushed me to get started on it:
