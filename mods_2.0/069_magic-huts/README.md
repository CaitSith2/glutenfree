Factory Planner itself does not support outputting quality, and additionally recipes that require spoiling input/output won't work either,
and just like the 1.1 version beacons are not supported because figuring how the zone overlaps and distrubution modifiers is quite a pain.

- this mod uses MIT licenced content from [Factorissimo 3](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/factorissimo-2-notnotmelon) by various authors.
- the "space" graphic files originate from Crazy_Editor's MIT licenced `space-factorissimo-lizard` mod

Release notice: 1.0.0 does not support fluids yet so barrel them, some bugs / crashes / exploits are to be expected, preview build.
