> **The 2.0 port for the mod linked below, named after how my playthrough buddies kept referring to them, since well it was a mouthfull:**

Factory Planner itself does not support outputting quality, and additionally recipes that require spoiling input/output won't work either,
and just like the 1.1 version beacons are supported for the simple fact that the math of how to share them would be too hard to calculate.

- this mod uses MIT licenced content from [Factorissimo 3](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/factorissimo-2-notnotmelon) by various authors.

Release notice: 1.0.0 does not support fluids yet so barrel them, some bugs / crashes / exploits are to be expected, preview build.
