Did you clear out all nearby nests on nauvis and now regret it since you want eggs?

Well fear not, just capture a nest and steal some eggs and manage to make your own spawner!

The biters spawned by this contraption will seak out nesting sites nearby and setup camp there.

(personally not really a fan of the craftable captured spawner, the recipe is weird, swapped for this)
