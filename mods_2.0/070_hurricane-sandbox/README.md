Pretty much a mod made for the personal use of Hurricane046 in order to possibly assist him with checking his sprites ingame,
you're free to take a peek, but just assume that issues like some building having a bigger shadow just means a new format upstream.

Note that this mod does **not** work out of the box, and is **not** intended to be used on multiplayer at all.

The purpose for this mod is to load all of Hurricane's assets using a generic loader,
that way he can verify if everything works ingame, and other mods can scrape together code from here.

Usage:
- unzip the mod
- download the factorio-sprites folder from his google drive and unzip it in this mod's folder
- run the script that parses the assets and generates the require configuration files
- start a new singleplayer game
