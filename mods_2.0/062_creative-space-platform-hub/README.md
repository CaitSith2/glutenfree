Sure, editor mode has instant blueprints, but i often test stuff in `/cheat all` mode.

This mod allows players in cheat mode or editor mode to `ALT + scroll` up & down to toggle cheat mode for platforms.

Your hand must be empty, so no item/ghost/tool.

This mod works for existing platforms, and removing this mod again does not delete or damage platforms in any way.
