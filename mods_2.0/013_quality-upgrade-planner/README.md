Usage:

run the `/quality-upgrade-planner` command to get a book that has a page for each quality,
dragging that book over an area will request an upgrade of everything selected to that tier.

Planned features:

- ~~less bizzare thumbnail~~
- a shortcut button, so you don't have to run the command every time
- ~~caching the item in a script inventory and merely giving a copy when triggered~~
- supporting quality that is out of order, contact me if you know of a mod that breaks this one

- cube/dice shape derived from the outlines of https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-xrouj
