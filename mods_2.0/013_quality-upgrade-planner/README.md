Usage:

- click the shortcut button that looks like the thumbnail of this mod.
- to configure: click the shortcut button again, or rightclick with it on the ground.
- to change quality: alt+scroll with it in your hand, the quality does not need to be unlocked.
- to change multiple options at once: shift-click one of the switches and they will all move along.

Planned features:

- extra configuration per mode, like a blacklist for belts, pipes & rails.
- support to change named logistic/signal groups, the engine does not allow changing edit history.

Ideas please:

- currently it rather crudely just does everything that falls within the scope of a mode,
- if you have ideas for how to finetune it or just wish something worked a little differently, reach out.
- also, if you wish for more features, like train schedules, display panel stuff, station name icons, etc, do tell.
