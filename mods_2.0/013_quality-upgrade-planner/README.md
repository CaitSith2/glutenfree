Usage:

run the `/quality-upgrade-planner` command to get a book that has a page for each quality,
dragging that book over an area will request an upgrade of everything selected to that tier.

Planned features:

- ~~less bizzare thumbnail~~
- ~~a shortcut button, so you don't have to run the command every time~~
- ~~caching the item in a script inventory and merely giving a copy when triggered~~
- supporting quality that is out of order, contact me if you know of a mod that breaks this one

- cube/dice shape derived from the outlines of https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-xrouj

# 2.0.0

Contains a whole bunch of prepwork to support extra options (try clicking the shortcut twice, wink wink ;)

This version gets rid of the command and has replaced it with a shortcut button.

Also, since it is no longer a blueprint book you'll have to use alt+scroll instead of shift+scroll.
